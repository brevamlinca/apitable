Call of Duty Advanced Warfare is a first-person shooter game that was released in 2014. The game features futuristic weapons and gadgets, as well as exoskeletons that enhance the abilities of the soldiers. If you want to have more fun and challenge in the game, you can use a trainer that modifies some aspects of the gameplay.
 
A trainer is a program that runs in the background while you play the game. It allows you to activate certain cheats or features by pressing specific keys on your keyboard. For example, you can enable infinite health, ammo, grenades, or money. You can also disable enemy AI, increase your speed, or change your jump height.

Another drawback of using a trainer is that it may ruin the game's balance and challenge. The game was designed to be played with certain rules and limitations, and using a trainer may make the game too easy or boring. You may also miss out on some of the game's features and achievements that require skill and effort. To avoid this, you should only use a trainer for testing purposes or for fun, and not rely on it too much.
 
Finally, using a trainer may be considered cheating by some players and developers. If you use a trainer online or in multiplayer mode, you may get banned or reported by other players or the game's anti-cheat system. This may result in losing your account, progress, or access to the game. To avoid this, you should only use a trainer offline or in single-player mode, and respect the rules and rights of other players and developers.
